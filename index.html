            <ol>
              <li>
                "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
                anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
                unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
                constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
                assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
                Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
                defined below) for the purposes of this License.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
                Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
                musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
                picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
                condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be
                recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
                constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
                Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
                avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or
                sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
                timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
                considered a Derivative Work for the  purpose of this License.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
                under the terms of this License.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created
                the Work.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under

              </li>
              <li>
                "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
                this License who has not previously violated the terms of this

                permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this

                to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more

              <li>
                For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical

                  <li>
                    Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
                    waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
                    individually or via a performance rights society
                    (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
                    performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
                    of the Work.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
                    the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
                    via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry

                    Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

                Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
                doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
                exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
                performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
                the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,

                publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of
                this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
                Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
                phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
                publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not
                offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
                the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the
                rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You
                must keep intactall notices that refer to this License and to
                the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly
                display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the
                Work with any technological measures that control access or use
                of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
                License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
                incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
                the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made
                subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
                Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
                extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any
                reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as
                requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from
                any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
                the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the
                Original Author, as requested.

                publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
                Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices
                for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to
                the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
                pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied;
                the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
                practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
                Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
                URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
                information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
                a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
                (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
                "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
                credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
                however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
                Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
                comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
                prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

          Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        </p>
        <p>
          Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
          conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
          original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
          and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
          following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
          exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
          use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material
          in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.
          Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand
          the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying
          it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying
          our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.
          Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the
          license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used
          under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations
          for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
        </p>
        <p>
          Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
          licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material
          under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is
          not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable
          exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated
          by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright
          and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use
          of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons,
          including because others have copyright or other rights in the
          material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that
          all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our
          licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
          reasonable. More considerations for the public:
